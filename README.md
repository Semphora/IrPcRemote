Once more. but better.
This was supposed to be a quick project that would allow me to use a Digispark a, a 1838B ir sensor and an old Canon RS02 remote to to controll my pc remotely.
And here we are.

What you'll need.
+ a Digispark
+ a 1838B ir sensor
+ some way to send ir commands

For this walk through we'll assume a clean install of the arduino ide and that you are able to get a blink example going on your Digispark.
